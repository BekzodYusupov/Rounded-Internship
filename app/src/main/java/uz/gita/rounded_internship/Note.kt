______________________________________My Experience_________________________________________________
First of all, I want to thank Rounded LLC for giving me such an opportunity.
Even though the task may seem simple it is not.
The task is well thought out to test one's ability to follow solid and dry principles in practice.
I have learned a thing or two while doing the task.

70% app actually finished on the first day but with messy code.
On the second day almost didn't code, and on the last day tried my best to clean it up :).
Of course, there is still much room to improve.
If I qualify, I would further polish my skills during the internship period ;).
